summary: |
  Over the past decade, I've worked across India, USA, Japan, and Australia, contributing to large-scale technology transformations. At ANZx, I've served as Acting Tech Lead and Senior Cloud Engineer, focused on deep technical delivery. My work centres on GCP, Kubernetes, Golang, Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tooling and API enablement. Before joining ANZx, I was a Senior Consultant at Momenton Pty. Ltd.

Additionally, I have worked as an "Expert Software Engineer" for a leading ERP company in Tokyo, Japan, where I performed a range of Full Stack Web Development activities.

  I actively explore emerging technologies including AI-assisted development workflows and local LLM deployments.
